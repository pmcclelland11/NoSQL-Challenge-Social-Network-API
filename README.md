# UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp - Module 18 Challenge
## NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API
For our 18th challenge of the course, we were tasked to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. For this application, I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

## User Story
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
